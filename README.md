# Wakbuilder

This site is a fan tool made with resources Ankama has provided on the official site and on the forums. Neither I nor the site have any connection to Wakfu or Ankama.

I built this tool because I wanted an easier way to search for items in the game and other tools either weren't updated or weren't in English.

If you have any questions, bug reports, or suggestions, please send me an email at wakbuilder@gmail.com.
